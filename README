DATA FILES =====================================================================

motorway.txt
        Each line has two data items on it.
                The first item is the vehicle count.
                The second item is the time, in HHMMSS (hour minute second) format.


chickens.txt
        Each line has just one data item on it.

        Every third line represents an item in the control block.  
                (that is, line 1, 4, 7, 10, etc. )

        Every third line, starting from the second line, is the Low dose group 
                (lines 2, 5, 8, 11, etc.)

        Every third line, starting from the third line, is the High dose group.


pollution.txt
        Each line has two data items on it.
                The first item is the annual mean concentration of sulphur dioxide.
                The second item is the city where it was recorded, as a string. 




HEADER FILE ====================================================================

The header file included in this collection (selectionSort.h) provides the 
following 3 functions for use in your final Lab 8 program:


    // public prototyes

    // sort_array() will sort an array using the selection sort algorithm
    void sort_array( int a[], int n, char sortorder );
	//  a[] is the array to be sorted
	//  n   is the number of elements in the array with valid numeric data
	//  sortorder  is either SORT_ASCENDING or SORT_DESCENDING



    // chomp() will remove a trailing newline from a string, often the result
	of reading in a string from a file using the standard fgets() function.
    void chomp( char a[] );
	//  a[] is a string which may contain a newline '\n' at the end of it.
	//      if it does, then chomp removes it from the string.



    void skip_file_input_line( FILE *IN );
	//  IN is a FILE variable pointing to a file that has already been 
	//      opened with the standard fopen( ) function.
